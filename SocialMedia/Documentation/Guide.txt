This document serves as a guide to the features of this project.

FEATURES

- User
	- A user is merely the record in the Identity User plugin database.
	- It is used to get a profile.

- Profile
	- Holds public information like name, bio, profile picture.
	- Profile name is two fields: FirstName, and LastName, but is sent to client as one combined name.
	- The profile password is not really a password at all, but instead a unique link that ties the profile to a user.

- Friends
	- A friend record acts as a request and an accepted friend.
	- A relationship is a ProfileID pair (to and from).
	- A bool type field tracks whether the invitation has been accepted.
	- Friend status is attached to the profile view model and full profile view model when sent to the client.
		- Status: me,			 Response: Do nothing.

PATTERNS

- Lazy Loading
	- For most tables, there is a shortcut method in the repository class for selecting a range.
		- The post table is an exception. There is a distinction between public post feed and profile post feed so the method for
		selecting a range of posts is held in the post controller.

- Dropdowns

- Sudo-iterative JS objs (ContentBox.contentBoxes)
